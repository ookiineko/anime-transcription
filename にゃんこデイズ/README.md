also known as "nyanko days"

slice-of-life stuff. each episode of this anime is very short. not hard, probably good targets for learning

## transcription progress

this anime is adapted from its original manga work, by looking the manga helps a lot with the transcription (you can find the most or a lot of lines in there which stayed exactly the same inside anime version); unfortunately, the manga version generally does not have furigana except a few spots
