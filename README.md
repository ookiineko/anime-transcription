Anime Transcription
===================

This repository contains dialogue lines for some Japanese animes I transcribe for fun (when subtitles for it is not available in [kitsunekko](https://kitsunekko.net/dirlist.php?dir=subtitles%2Fjapanese%2F))

timed subtitles can be created later if me or someone else willing to put efforts into it

## What

consider it as a hint for if you plan to immerse in these animes

## Limitations

sometimes its only snippets bcs i mostly do only when i figured it's useful for my learning. expect it to be incomplete. (it takes a lot of time and work to do unofficial stuffs like this and check)

this project exists only to assit immersions, it's not the same thing as subtitles. if you're just started, it might be more of a wise choice to learn from an anime that HAS official Japanese subtitles available instead. Anyway, at here, i assume you already have certain ability to read the trascriptions and then do logical analyzations yourself, because i will not update previous texts when something have been uncovered in later episodes. ideally, u only read the transcriptions when u need and once you got what u needed u you will go back and be on your own again

> [!WARNING]
> im not responsible for if you turn animes into your reading practice and later suffer from consequences of *premature reading* (like accents and speaking), you're warned; however, you might not care this if all of your goal is to understand anime, instead of getting as close as a native. trade it off yourself

## How to use

> [!WARNING]
> use at your own risks; transcription might contain errors

open those `.txt` files using any text viewer; for example, while u watch the anime you can pause and look up anything u wanna know

## Format agreements

some measures for keeping this project even maintainable:

- no punc
- no onomatopoeia
- wrap long sentences when sensible
- group related short sentences to improve balance
- use common repr for word; make it look clear
- annotate person names, ambiguous pronunciations etc.
- be consist w/ whats said and/or showed on screen

focus on general readability but no more than that; it's not necessary to strictly follow official lyrics

instead of emulating what the text would be if it an official release, better to emulate what the text would be if written by a person who watch this anime without any other context

> [!NOTE]
> not to paste foreign texts copied from somewhere else directly

keyboard used: google Mozc

## Challenges

sometimes these tricky things are encountered and their possible solutions (if any):

- **very specific term, or like person names**: try to look up wiki, or original work (like manga, novel) might help
- **too hard to hear**: sometimes AI like [whisper](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp) do better. but verify them carefully before committing to Git
- **dialects, slangs or spoken lang that is hard to transcribe**: can't really do much. replace them with closest equivalents, or skip those parts, or pick a better anime to work on that don't have a lot of them

while try bests to handle them, these things will make it even harder to maintain this project, and it's not your fault

if you're at enough level, you can contribute to this project to help more people with their learning journey

> [!IMPORTANT]
> try to pick a relatively older anime that still have no JA subs ripped. working on a just-released anime might turn out their subs get uploaded a bit later so your work become somewhat useless. (unless you know what you're doing and ok with that)


## TODO

- [ ] a shorter readme
- [x] add a *free* license

### Wishlist

at this moment, i'm not yet sure about how to allow collaborative works to happen in this project reliability and how to review contributions

> [!NOTE]
> not to send Issues on github to request an anime bcs it is most likely not how it works
